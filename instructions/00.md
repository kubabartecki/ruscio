# Getting Started
#### 1. Start by creating a new binary-based Cargo project:

`cargo new rocket-cryptography --bin`

The nightly Rust toolchain enables certain improved developer experiences, such as better compile-time diagnostics, when developing with Rocket.\
So, weâ€™ll navigate to the new project directory from our terminal and configure Rust nightly as our project toolchain:

`cd rocket-cryptography` \
`rustup override set nightly`

#### 2. Now, add Rocket as a dependency in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0"
```

#### 3. Modify `src/main.rs` for the Rocket Hello, world! program:

```rs
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/", routes![index])
}
```

#### 4. Compile and run the program

Write `cargo run` in your console

It should download necessary packages for the first time, then complie program and run.

You should see something like this in the console.

```

```

#### 5. See the results

And admire beautiful `Hello, world!`
